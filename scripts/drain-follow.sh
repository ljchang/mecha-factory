# The drain loop: hold a request open on the box, process what lands, repeat.
#
# This is the "instant invite" half of the freshness story (the fast freebusy
# timer is the other). `drain --wait 25` long-polls `GET /v1/queue` — the box
# answers the moment a record lands, or empty at the cap — so a confirmed
# booking reaches home, becomes a calendar event, and mails its provider
# invite seconds after the visitor's click. The connection is initiated here
# every time: the box still never dials home, and this loop is nothing a
# crontab could not do slower.
#
# Deliberately a dumb loop, like the trigger daemon: each iteration is the
# same drain-then-sweep a hand run performs, the sweep is flock-guarded in
# `mecha-mail bookings` itself (the fifteen-minute timer also runs it), and
# the ledger makes re-runs idempotent. A drain failure sleeps and retries —
# the box being down must not turn this into a busy loop.
#
# Install: cp scripts/mecha-drain.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
#          systemctl --user daemon-reload
#          systemctl --user enable --now mecha-drain.service
